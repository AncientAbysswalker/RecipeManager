    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>This website is a front-end interface for my personal recipe database. You can sign up and use it to create your own recipes, or favorite recipes made by other people.</p>
    <p>This application is technically still under development so some things might change. I don't claim that this is perfect, and there are definitely some things I would like to change and/or improve, but for now the application is moving into a period of functional testing.</p>
